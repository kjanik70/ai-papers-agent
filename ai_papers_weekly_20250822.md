Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.. However, they often fall short in tasks requiring precise computations..

Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning process.. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning ability of LLM is still unclear.. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied.. We introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various domains.. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost (PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning efficiency.. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and non-mathematical tasks..

Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more streamlined reasoning.. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks..

  Reasoning

Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations.. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability..

To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis.. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios.. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL.. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers.. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations..

Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses..

## 3. EcomMMMU: Strategic Utilization of Visuals for Robust Multimodal
  E-Commerce Models

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** August 21, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of images that depict product details.. However, this raises an important question: do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes introduce redundancy or degrade performance?.

Existing datasets are limited in both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this question.. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.. EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8 essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.. Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve performance and can, in some cases, degrade it.. This indicates that MLLMs may struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.. Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before using them for downstream tasks..

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI.. The data and code are available through https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25..

## 4. StreamMem: Query-Agnostic KV Cache Memory for Streaming Video
  Understanding

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** August 21, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Yanlai Yang, Zhuokai Zhao, Satya Narayan Shukla et al. (+4 more)

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos remains limited.. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs substantial memory and computational overhead..

Existing visual compression methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video understanding and multi-turn conversational settings.. In this work, we propose StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video understanding..

Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.. Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware compression approaches..

## 5. GRAFT: GRaPH and Table Reasoning for Textual Alignment -- A Benchmark
  for Structured Instruction Following and Visual Reasoning

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** August 21, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks.. It features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables, created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data semantics, structure, and clarity..

Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based solely on visual content.. Answers are provided in structured formats such as JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output format.. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation, and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment..

Reference answers follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based evaluation.. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field..
