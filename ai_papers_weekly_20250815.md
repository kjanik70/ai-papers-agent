Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology.. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering (VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language reasoning..

In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain metastases (MET).. Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items.. Models were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both visual and reasoning tasks.. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%), and GPT-5-nano (35.85%)..

Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single model dominating across all cohorts.. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks, but not at a level acceptable for clinical use..

## 2. The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in
  Clinical Natural Language Inference

Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured, generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.. We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction..

Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual access from failures of inference.. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both direct and chain of thought prompting.. Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25).. Despite low accuracy, output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts..

These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations: current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably (e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating counterfactuals).. Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains..

## 3. EgoCross: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Cross-Domain
  Egocentric Video Question Answering

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** August 14, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering (EgocentricQA).. However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning..

In contrast, real-world deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ substantially in both visual style and semantic content.. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA.. EgoCross covers four diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports, and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application scenarios.. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips, spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and counting.. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support fine-grained evaluation.. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs, whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.. Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements..

We hope EgoCross and our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding.. Data and codes will be released at: \href{https://github.com/MyUniverse0726/EgoCross}{https://github.com/MyUniverse0726/EgoCross.}.

## 4. GenOM: Ontology Matching with Description Generation and Large Language
  Model

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** August 14, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Yiping Song, Jiaoyan Chen, Renate A. Schmidt

Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources, particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts related to diseases and pharmaceuticals.. This paper introduces GenOM, a large language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision..

Extensive experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods.. Further ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting, highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability..

## 5. MSRS: Adaptive Multi-Subspace Representation Steering for Attribute
  Alignment in Large Language Models

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** August 14, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Xinyan Jiang, Lin Zhang, Jiayi Zhang et al. (+4 more)

Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.. However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes, often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs..

To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation fine-tuning.. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's representation space.. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions.. A dynamic weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise control..

During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation.. Experimental results show that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream tasks..
