## 1. FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning

We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL).. Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity..

In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution.. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories..

We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks.. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning..

WARNING: This paper contains examples of offensive materials.. Toxic content has become pervasive on social media platforms..

We introduce SMARTER, a data-efficient two-stage framework for explainable content moderation using Large Language Models (LLMs).. In Stage 1, we leverage LLMs' own outputs to generate synthetic explanations for both correct and incorrect labels, enabling alignment via preference optimization with minimal human supervision.. In Stage 2, we refine explanation quality through cross-model training, allowing weaker models to align stylistically and semantically with stronger ones..

Experiments on three benchmark tasks -- HateXplain, Latent Hate, and Implicit Hate -- demonstrate that SMARTER enables LLMs to achieve up to a 13.5% macro-F1 improvement over standard few-shot baselines while using only a fraction of the full training data.. Our framework offers a scalable strategy for low-resource settings by harnessing LLMs' self-improving capabilities for both classification and explanation..

## 3. Internalizing Self-Consistency in Language Models: Multi-Agent Consensus
  Alignment

🧠 **Category:** CS.AI | 📅 **Published:** September 18, 2025 | 🔥 **Score:** 25 points

Language Models (LMs) are inconsistent reasoners, often generating contradictory responses to identical prompts.. While inference-time methods can mitigate these inconsistencies, they fail to address the core problem: LMs struggle to reliably select reasoning pathways leading to consistent outcomes under exploratory sampling..

To address this, we formalize self-consistency as an intrinsic property of well-aligned reasoning models and introduce Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), a reinforcement learning framework that post-trains models to favor reasoning trajectories aligned with their internal consensus using majority/minority outcomes from multi-agent debate.. These trajectories emerge from deliberative exchanges where agents ground reasoning in peer arguments, not just aggregation of independent attempts, creating richer consensus signals than single-round majority voting..

MACA enables agents to teach themselves to be more decisive and concise, and better leverage peer insights in multi-agent settings without external supervision, driving substantial improvements across self-consistency (+27.6% on GSM8K), single-agent reasoning (+23.7% on MATH), sampling-based inference (+22.4% Pass@20 on MATH), and multi-agent ensemble decision-making (+42.7% on MathQA).. These findings, coupled with strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3% on GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA), demonstrate robust self-alignment that more reliably unlocks latent reasoning potential of language models..

## 4. Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation for Speech Large Language Models

🧠 **Category:** CS.AI | 📅 **Published:** September 18, 2025 | 🔥 **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Enzhi Wang, Qicheng Li, Zhiyuan Tang et al. (+1 more)

**Links:** [ArXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14930v1) | [PDF Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14930v1.pdf)

In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of catastrophic forgetting and modality inequivalence in speech large language models, showing that introducing speech capabilities can degrade knowledge and reasoning even when inputs remain textual, and performance further decreases with spoken queries..

To address these challenges, we propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages both text-to-text and speech-to-text channels to transfer knowledge from a text-based teacher model to a speech LLM.. Extensive experiments on dialogue and audio understanding tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving textual knowledge, improving cross-modal alignment, and enhancing reasoning in speech-based interactions..

## 5. Empathy-R1: A Chain-of-Empathy and Reinforcement Learning Framework for
  Long-Form Mental Health Support

🧠 **Category:** CS.AI | 📅 **Published:** September 18, 2025 | 🔥 **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Xianrong Yao, Dong She, Chenxu Zhang et al. (+5 more)

**Links:** [ArXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14851v1) | [PDF Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14851v1.pdf)

Empathy is critical for effective mental health support, especially when addressing Long Counseling Texts (LCTs).. However, existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly in a Chinese context..

To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs.. Inspired by cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its thinking process both transparent and interpretable.. Our framework is empowered by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training process.. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure.. Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses.. Experiments show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics..

More importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our new benchmark.. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses, Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support..
