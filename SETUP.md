# AI Papers Agent Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Complete Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get your free AI papers agent running on GitHub Actions.

## Step 1: Create Repository

1. **Create a new GitHub repository**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new public repository
   - Name it something like `ai-papers-agent`
   - Initialize with a README

2. **Upload the files**
   - Create the following files in your repository:
     - `main.py` (the main script)
     - `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)
     - `.github/workflows/weekly-papers.yml` (GitHub Actions workflow)
   - Create an empty `published_papers.db` file (will be used by the script)

## Step 2: Set Up Gmail App Password

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail**
   - Go to your Google Account settings
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ Turn on

2. **Generate App Password**
   - Go to Google Account â†’ Security â†’ App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the 16-character password (save this!)

## Step 3: Find Your Substack Email

1. **Get your Substack publication email**
   - Go to your Substack dashboard
   - Settings â†’ Publication details
   - Look for "Email address" - it looks like `yourname-123abc@substack.com`
   - Copy this email address

## Step 4: Get Hugging Face Token (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Create free Hugging Face account**
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/join
   - Sign up for free

2. **Generate access token**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Access Tokens
   - Create new token with "Read" permissions
   - Copy the token (starts with `hf_`)

## Step 5: Configure GitHub Secrets

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub**
   - Click Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions

2. **Add the following secrets:**

   **Required secrets:**
   ```
   GMAIL_EMAIL = your_gmail@gmail.com
   GMAIL_PASSWORD = your_16_character_app_password
   SUBSTACK_EMAIL = yourname-123abc@substack.com
   ```

   **Optional (for better summaries):**
   ```
   HF_TOKEN = hf_your_hugging_face_token
   ```

## Step 6: Test the Setup

1. **Manual test run**
   - Go to Actions tab in your repository
   - Click "Weekly AI Papers" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" â†’ "Run workflow"
   - Watch the logs to ensure it works

2. **Check for issues**
   - Look for any error messages in the Actions log
   - Verify that `published_papers.db` was created/updated
   - Check your email to see if Substack received the post

## Step 7: Customize (Optional)

### Adjust the Schedule
Edit `.github/workflows/weekly-papers.yml`:
```yaml
schedule:
  # Run every Friday at 6 PM UTC
  - cron: '0 18 * * 5'
```

Change the cron expression:
- `0 18 * * 5` = Friday 6 PM UTC
- `0 21 * * 4` = Thursday 9 PM UTC
- `0 14 * * 6` = Saturday 2 PM UTC

### Modify Categories
In `main.py`, edit the `categories` list:
```python
categories = ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"]
```

Available arXiv categories:
- `cs.AI` - Artificial Intelligence
- `cs.LG` - Machine Learning  
- `cs.CV` - Computer Vision
- `cs.CL` - Computation and Language
- `cs.NE` - Neural Networks
- `cs.RO` - Robotics
- `stat.ML` - Statistics Machine Learning

### Adjust Scoring Weights
In the `calculate_paper_score()` function, modify weights:
```python
social_score = (
    twitter_data['mentions'] * 5 +      # Increase for more Twitter weight
    twitter_data['engagement'] * 0.1 +
    reddit_score * 2 +                  # Increase for more Reddit weight
    hn_score * 3 +                      # Hacker News weight
    github_stars * 0.8                  # GitHub implementation weight
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Gmail Authentication Error:**
- Make sure 2FA is enabled
- Use App Password, not regular password
- Check that GMAIL_EMAIL and GMAIL_PASSWORD secrets are set correctly

**No Papers Found:**
- Check if arXiv is accessible
- Verify the date range (script looks for past 7 days)
- Try running manually to see error messages

**Scraping Errors:**
- Some websites may be temporarily down
- Rate limiting is built in, but some sites may block requests
- The script will continue with partial data

**Substack Not Receiving Email:**
- Double-check your Substack email address
- Check spam folder
- Verify email was sent (check GitHub Actions logs)
- Try sending a test email to your Substack address

**GitHub Actions Failed:**
- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Verify all secrets are set correctly
- Make sure repository has Actions enabled

### Debug Mode

To run with more verbose output, you can temporarily add debug prints:

```python
# Add this at the top of main.py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Manual Testing

You can test locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export GMAIL_EMAIL="your_email@gmail.com"
export GMAIL_PASSWORD="your_app_password"
export SUBSTACK_EMAIL="your_substack_email@substack.com"
export HF_TOKEN="your_hf_token"

# Run the script
python main.py
```
