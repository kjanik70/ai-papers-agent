# 🤖 AI Papers Weekly Agent

**Automatically discover, rank, and publish the top 5 AI papers every week - completely free!**

This agent analyzes social media buzz, GitHub activity, and academic metrics to surface the most interesting AI research papers from the past week, then automatically publishes beautiful weekly digests to your Substack.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Smart Discovery**: Scans arXiv for latest AI/ML papers across multiple categories
- 📊 **Social Media Analysis**: Tracks mentions on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, and GitHub
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Summaries**: Generates concise, readable summaries using Hugging Face models
- 📧 **Auto-Publishing**: Sends beautifully formatted emails directly to Substack
- 🚫 **Duplicate Prevention**: Maintains database to ensure fresh content weekly
- 💰 **100% Free**: Runs entirely on free services and APIs

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Every Friday at 6 PM**: GitHub Actions triggers the agent
2. **Paper Discovery**: Fetches recent papers from arXiv (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.CL, etc.)
3. **Social Analysis**: Scrapes mentions and engagement across social platforms
4. **Intelligent Ranking**: Combines social buzz, keywords, recency, and author metrics
5. **Summary Generation**: Creates 2-3 paragraph summaries of top papers
6. **Automatic Publishing**: Sends formatted digest to your Substack via email
7. **Database Update**: Tracks published papers to avoid duplicates

## 📊 Scoring Algorithm

Papers are ranked using a weighted combination of:

- **Social Media Buzz** (40%): Twitter mentions, Reddit upvotes, HN points
- **Academic Impact** (30%): Author count, citation potential, venue prestige  
- **Relevance** (20%): Keyword matching, category importance
- **Recency** (10%): Publication date (newer = higher score)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Gmail account with 2FA enabled
- Substack publication

### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Fork this repository**

2. **Set up Gmail App Password**:
   - Enable 2FA on Gmail
   - Generate App Password: Google Account → Security → App passwords
   - Save the 16-character password

3. **Find your Substack email**:
   - Substack Dashboard → Settings → Publication details
   - Copy the email address (format: `yourname-123abc@substack.com`)

4. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, add:
   ```
   GMAIL_EMAIL = your_gmail@gmail.com
   GMAIL_PASSWORD = your_16_character_app_password  
   SUBSTACK_EMAIL = yourname-123abc@substack.com
   HF_TOKEN = hf_your_hugging_face_token (optional)
   ```

5. **Test the setup**:
   - Go to Actions → Weekly AI Papers → Run workflow
   - Check logs for any errors
   - Verify Substack receives the email

That's it! Your agent will now run automatically every Friday. 🎉

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adjust Categories
Edit the `categories` list in `main.py`:
```python
categories = ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"]
```

### Change Schedule  
Modify the cron expression in `.github/workflows/weekly-papers.yml`:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 18 * * 5'  # Friday 6 PM UTC
```

### Tune Scoring Weights
Adjust weights in the `calculate_paper_score()` function:
```python
social_score = (
    twitter_data['mentions'] * 5 +
    reddit_score * 2 +
    hn_score * 3 +
    github_stars * 0.8
)
```

## 📊 Technical Details

**Architecture**: Python script running on GitHub Actions
**Data Sources**: arXiv API, web scraping (Twitter/nitter, Reddit, HN, GitHub)
