# AI Papers Agent 🤖📚

**Automated weekly AI papers digest for Substack - completely free!**

This intelligent agent automatically discovers, ranks, and publishes the top 5 AI research papers every week to your Substack publication. It analyzes social media buzz, GitHub activity, and academic metrics to surface the most interesting and impactful AI research from the past week.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Smart Discovery**: Scans arXiv for latest AI/ML papers across multiple categories
- 📊 **Social Media Analysis**: Tracks mentions on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, and GitHub
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Summaries**: Generates concise, readable summaries using Hugging Face models
- 📧 **Auto-Publishing**: Sends beautifully formatted emails directly to Substack
- 🚫 **Duplicate Prevention**: Maintains database to ensure fresh content weekly
- 💰 **100% Free**: Runs entirely on free services and APIs
- ⏰ **Automated Schedule**: Runs every Friday at 6 PM UTC via GitHub Actions

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Paper Discovery**: Fetches recent papers from arXiv (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.CL, etc.)
2. **Social Analysis**: Scrapes mentions and engagement across social platforms
3. **Intelligent Ranking**: Combines social buzz, keywords, recency, and author metrics
4. **Summary Generation**: Creates 2-3 paragraph summaries of top papers
5. **Automatic Publishing**: Sends formatted digest to your Substack via email
6. **Database Update**: Tracks published papers to avoid duplicates

## 📈 Ranking Algorithm

Papers are ranked using a weighted combination of:

- **Social Media Buzz (40%)**: Twitter mentions, Reddit upvotes, HN points
- **Academic Impact (30%)**: Author count, citation potential, venue prestige
- **Relevance (20%)**: Keyword matching, category importance
- **Recency (10%)**: Publication date (newer = higher score)

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Gmail account with 2FA enabled
- Substack publication
- Hugging Face account (optional, for enhanced summaries)
