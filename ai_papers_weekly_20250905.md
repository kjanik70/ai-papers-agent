While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new query.. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks..

We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language.. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates.. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences.. On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute.. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales..

Moreover, we confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement..

## 2. Towards a Unified View of Large Language Model Post-Training

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** September 04, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or other-model demonstrations) data.. These two types of data are typically used by approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), respectively..

In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process.. We derive a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance tradeoffs.. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate, and likelihood gradient.. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different training signals.. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning patterns..

We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT.. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and families..

## 3. EvoEmo: Towards Evolved Emotional Policies for LLM Agents in Multi-Turn
  Negotiation

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** September 04, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Yunbo Long, Liming Xu, Lukas Beckenbauer et al. (+2 more)

**Links:** [ArXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04310v1) | [PDF Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04310v1.pdf)

Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex}, \textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI.. However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts..

To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations.. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios.. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation..

Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings.. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation..

## 4. Intermediate Languages Matter: Formal Languages and LLMs affect
  Neurosymbolic Reasoning

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** September 04, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Alexander Beiser, David Penz, Nysret Musliu

**Links:** [ArXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04083v1) | [PDF Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04083v1.pdf)

Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of tasks.. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind..

A promising approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning.. It works by using LLMs as translators from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct results.. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning remain unclear.. This paper demonstrates that one previously overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language.. We introduce the intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for neurosymbolic reasoning..

By comparing four formal languages across three datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities.. We also discuss the varying effects across different LLMs..

## 5. CoT-Space: A Theoretical Framework for Internal Slow-Thinking via
  Reinforcement Learning

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** September 04, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Zeyu Gan, Hao Yi, Yong Liu

**Links:** [ArXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04027v1) | [PDF Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04027v1.pdf)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).. However, a significant theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)..

To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space, a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous, reasoning-level semantic space.. By analyzing this process from both a noise perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting..

Furthermore, extensive experiments provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings.. Our framework not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents..
