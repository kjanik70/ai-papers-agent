As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and more complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their conversational goals?. We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users better manage goal progress..

OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal alignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results with examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to navigate complex dialogues more effectively.. Through a study with 20 participants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat interface without goal tracking..

Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and effort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to overcome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can enhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues.. Our findings inspired design implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal communication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable feedback to improve LLM performance..

Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios.. However, existing academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice, typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors..

To mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world challenges with hierarchical generalization testing.. Specifically, HydraFake involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures, emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains.. Building on this resource, we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake detector.. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as "planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process.. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake reasoning capacities into current MLLMs..

Experiments on HydraFake dataset reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.. Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs..

## 3. Inference-Time Alignment Control for Diffusion Models with Reinforcement
  Learning Guidance

Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching algorithms, have achieved remarkable success.. However, aligning their output distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences, compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging..

While reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after fine-tuning.. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward conditioning.. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average.. Our theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off without further training.. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.. Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment..

Our approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference.. The source code for RLG is publicly available at the Github: https://github.com/jinluo12345/Reinforcement-learning-guidance..

## 4. ChatThero: An LLM-Supported Chatbot for Behavior Change and Therapeutic
  Support in Addiction Recovery

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** August 28, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited personalized support.. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery..

We present ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI).. We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy, Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference optimization (DPO)..

In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral realism.. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research and clinical translation..

This paper presents our approach to the first Multimodal Personality-Aware Depression Detection Challenge, focusing on multimodal depression detection using machine learning and deep learning models..

We explore and compare the performance of XGBoost, transformer-based architectures, and large language models (LLMs) on audio, video, and text features.. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of each type of model in capturing depression-related signals across modalities, offering insights into effective multimodal representation strategies for mental health prediction..
