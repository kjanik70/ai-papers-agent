AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental limitations of autoregressive LLMs.. On the other hand, humans are general agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and plans..

Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning.. Based on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation.. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language.. Experiments on difficult web browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from 0\% to 32.2\%.. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm..

We are excited about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can act superintelligently in all environments.. To start, we make SimuRA, a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a research demo for public testing..

Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the inference of new facts.. Identifying logical rules not only improves the completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for reasoning and interpretation..

However, the complexity of such rules, combined with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for humans to understand.. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.. Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets, FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV.. We examine various prompting strategies, including zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and chain-of-thought reasoning.. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges..

Our results demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and clarity, although several challenges remain for future research.. All scripts and data used in this study are publicly available at https://github.com/idirlab/KGRule2NL}{https://github.com/idirlab/KGRule2NL..

## 3. Seed-Prover: Deep and Broad Reasoning for Automated Theorem Proving

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** July 31, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language.. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning..

In this work, we propose \textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model.. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization.. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.. Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin.. To address the lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines..

We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems.. This work represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning..

## 4. Can LLM-Reasoning Models Replace Classical Planning? A Benchmark Study

Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their potential for robotic task planning.. While these models demonstrate strong generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and executable plans remains uncertain..

This paper presents a systematic evaluation of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files, and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a variety of benchmarks.. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these models in this setting.. Our findings show that while the models perform well on simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict constraint compliance..

These results underscore fundamental challenges in applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments.. By outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of planning in autonomous robotics..

## 5. DICE: Dynamic In-Context Example Selection in LLM Agents via Efficient
  Knowledge Transfer

üß† **Category:** CS.AI | üìÖ **Published:** July 31, 2025 | üî• **Score:** 25 points

Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.. However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often leading to unstable or degraded performance..

While prior work has explored example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective demonstration across reasoning steps.. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that consistently benefit agent performance.. In this paper, we address this challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning.. Our approach decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious dependencies that impair generalization.. We further propose a stepwise selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance..

Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any additional training cost.. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient LLM agents..
