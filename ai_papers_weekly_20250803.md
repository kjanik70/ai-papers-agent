Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex, open-world environments.. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures, limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction from perception..

To address these limitations, we propose a unified Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion (cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered reasoning core.. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving..

Evaluations on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.. The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous driving systems..

  Understanding Tasks

While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension.. This gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly detailed model outputs..

To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks.. Generated via a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs.. The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced Audio Text Evaluation).. This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with cross-sample discriminability..

A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current capabilities and limitations.. The data and code are available at https://github.com/xiaomi-research/mecat.

## 3. Causal Reasoning in Pieces: Modular In-Context Learning for Causal
  Discovery

🧠 **Category:** CS.AI | 📅 **Published:** July 31, 2025 | 🔥 **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Kacper Kadziolka, Saber Salehkaleybar

Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.. Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations..

We study causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.. To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines..

We further probe the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and reasoning models.. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains..

## 4. MPCC: A Novel Benchmark for Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints
  in Multimodal Large Language Models

🧠 **Category:** CS.AI | 📅 **Published:** July 31, 2025 | 🔥 **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Yiyan Ji, Haoran Chen, Qiguang Chen et al. (+3 more)

Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps.. However, current benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit constraints across modalities..

To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning.. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning.. To solve the second challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to separate constraint complexity from search space expansion.. Experiments on 13 advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only 21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%..

Additionally, we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.. Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications..

## 5. LLM4Rail: An LLM-Augmented Railway Service Consulting Platform

🧠 **Category:** CS.AI | 📅 **Published:** July 31, 2025 | 🔥 **Score:** 25 points

**Authors:** Zhuo Li, Xianghuai Deng, Chiwei Feng et al. (+7 more)

Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of business.. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform..

Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat.. In LLM4Rail, we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting framework.. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate accurate responses.. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible takeout dataset tailored for railway services.. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness levels..

We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender for railway catering.. To address the unconstrained nature of open recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25 dataset..
